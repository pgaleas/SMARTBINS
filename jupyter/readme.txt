README
------
This directory contains the data captured with the sensors (smart-bins) and the Jupyter Notebook file to reproduce the harvest stages recognition example.
To execute the example, start a jupyter notebook in the same directory using the command "jupyter notebook" and run (on the started web browser) the file "Testing-Different-ML-Algorithms-for-Harvest Stage-Prediction.ipynb"

If Jupyter Notebook is not available on your PC, run the cloud version of this example from https://github.com/pgaleas/SMARTBINS. 
Please follow the instructions of the README.md file.
